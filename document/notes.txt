so for small application, @Scheduled might be fine.
and using the following strategies will help this application better but still still
be facing limitation
- moving to the next level would be using concurrency, multiple threads
- having multiple instance, like spining two docker container?
- limit your service checks so you don't over whelm your application
- retries and circuit breaker

so then move to a different archiecture, monolith to micro service
- dedicated endpoint/service checker
- message queue
- indexing and caching will help speed things up.
- using @Scheduled annotation is still needed but service different purpose.
  sends out an event or task to message queue to endpoint/service checker every
  60 seconds.

Q: not able to intialize data with data.sql
A:
spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always
have been chagned to
spring.sql.init.mode=always
in Spring 2.7.0 and after

and when using hibernate and jpa, the following property should be added to application.properties
if you plan to use data.sql to initialize the database
spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true
this way the data.sql will be executed after the schema.sql/hibernate ddl-auto/entity creation
